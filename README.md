## Getting Started

### First of all initiate a `Ton` variable

```dart
final _tonPlugin = Ton();
```

### Generating a random mnemonic:

```dart
_tonPlugin.randomMnemonic();
```
This function will return a Future of List of Strings which are the seed to your wallet.

### Generating a random mnemonic with password:

For doing this you have to pass the password as a String parameter.

```dart
_tonPlugin.randomMnemonic(password: "YOU_WALLET_PASSWORD");
```

This function will also return a Future of List of Strings which are the seed to your ton wallet.

### Check if a mnemonic is valid:

```dart
mnemonic = <String>['a', 'b', ...];
_tonPlugin.isMnemonicValid(mnemonic)
```
You can also pass your mnemonic's password if it has one.

## Web Configuration

Add the files in example project under `web` directory to your project and then add the script below to your `index.html` file
```dart
  <script src="ton-mnemonic/web/index.js"></script>
```

The files can be found here:
[Web Mnemonic Library](./example/web/ton-mnemonic)
